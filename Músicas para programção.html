        <h3>Dave x AJ Tracey - Thiago Silva</h3>
        <P>[Verse 1: Dave]<br> 
            Santan from the V-V x AJ <br>
            Man mystic with the pen like J.K <br> 
            True say, I ain't really a drinker <br> 
            But I got love for brandy like Ray J <br>
            Champagne popper, .44 chopper <br>
            In a black Nike bomber, heartbeat stopper <br>
            Half-heart MC dropper<br>
            .45 wapper, leave you in the states like Kaká <br> <br> 
            
            [Verse 2: AJ Tracey] <br>
            AJ from the l-l x Santan<br>
            Man's got style on the riddim like Gangnam <br>
            Two young bruddas tryna eat off of music<br>
            But we used to eat off of pebs and the sand bags<br>
            Now we get money, music money<br>
            Money that could put your girlfriend in a handbag<br>
            White tee, Balenciagas, man bag<br>
            Left-winger with a long stick like a granddad<br>
            AJ Tizzy from T-H-E lizzy<br>
            And I'm all out for the Lizzy<br>
            I don't wanna look like you, you're broke<br>
            And I've been telling broke bruddas "move" like Grizzy<br>
            Still brandy but the hand ting fizzy<br>
            Probs be in bin if a man weren't busy<br>
            I'm a mic king, I'm a king on the mic<br>
            And I'll spin bruddas til the whole scene gets dizzy <br> <br> 

            [Hook: Dave & AJ Tracey]<br>
            Walk in the rave, smile on my face<br>
            Drink in my cup, hand in my jeans<br>
            Man talk tough, man look up, down, left, right<br>
            Straight to a bang in the teeth<br>
            Man still talk tough, man saw man in the flesh<br>
            Now man's tryna talk to my Gs<br>
            Nah, none of that, none, .45 drum<br>
            Run you right out of your street<br>
            Walk in the dance, chicks wanna glance<br>
            Hand on my hip, shank for the dip<br>
            If I shout "oi", them man there best skip<br>
            Better tie up your laces tight and don't trip<br>
            Trip, get splashed<br>
            Couldn't care less about my man's gang<br>
            We're not fam, we're not friends or bredrins<br>
            You'll get tanned and binned, cock, then blam <br> <br>  

            [Verse 3: Dave]<br>
            Santan Dave from the Vale and Tracey<br>
            Duck man down on the road, I'm pacey<br>
            Two lighties on the phone, so facety<br>
            One named Jordan and one named Stacey<br>
            S with the S from the S, ask Showkey<br>
            Dust man down with a mask like Tobi<br>
            Tell a boy cotch, my man's telling me lots<br>
            But we are not Gs so don't watch my face <br> <br> 

            [Verse 4: AJ Tracey]<br>
            Ladbroke Grove is where I re- who?<br>
            Man get burst up in the G- who?<br>
            Came back with a fresh one, it's new<br>
            Don't come around for a two of the blue<br>
            I don't give a fuck if you're old or new<br>
            I'll just yawn like "blackball who?"<br>
            Put a couple dead MCs in the grave<br>
            Trust me, darg, you can go there too<br>
            Trust me, darg, you can go there free<br>
            I don't ever watch F-A-C-E<br>
            AJT from MTP<br>
            NikeLab tracksuit, Nike ID<br>
            Man got overly fucked in the beef<br>
            Pretty sure I landed a bang to his teeth<br>
            Man will get banged in the face by me<br>
            Not my bredrin, banged in the face by me <br> <br> 

            [Verse 5: Dave]<br>
            And me<br>
            Man talk tough, we'll see<br>
            Hit him with the left-right, left-right, left-right-right<br>
            One jab, then I duck, then weave<br>
            Come like Trevor from GTA<br>
            If I bang man's face, man bop, then lean<br>
            Kun Aguero, man dropped the shoulder feint once<br>
            Quick kick then I drop man's G<br>
            First time I link her, Nando's, sweet<br>
            £9.95, I swipe, then eat<br>
            I one-two rap, she don't give hat<br>
            Thiago Silva, man block, then skeet<br>
            Had man screaming "look, there's my man"<br>
            Hand in my pouch like "where? It's not me"<br>
            Hand in my pouch like "where? It's not us"<br>
            Turned to my G like "where? It's not we"<br>
            So if you get boom with the .45 long<br>
            It's a critical hit, no chance to repeat<br>
            And if you see Arge in the cut with the dip<br>
            You're pissed so quick your team should retreat<br>
            But if you see Juss in the cut with his right hand tucked<br>
            You're fucked, your team should leave, G<br>
            If you see Rapz in the back with his hand in the bag<br>
            It's mad, we came to see Ps <br> <br> 
        
        </P>

        <p>

            T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, theres both<br>
            Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke<br>
            Man spend it on both<br>
            Counting up this money from O or money from shows<br>
            Man's counting up both<br>
            Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home<br>
            Man patternin' both<br>
            Feds draw me out for a works and smoke<br>
            Tryna do me for both<br>
            They want me back on soch', using chips and rice<br>
            Tryna pattern me both<br>

            [Verse 1]<br>
            Me and T Buck see two opps on the mains<br>
            And we ended up doing up both<br>
            Too much beef on the streets<br>
            We're hitting two blocks and we're shooting up both<br>
            I know feds want me back up in courts<br>
            Sat in front of the judge just doing up oath<br>
            How many times in jail was it bread and oats?<br>
            Put peanut butter on both<br>
            Now they say that I'm the king of drill<br>
            Trap, rap, I'm doing it all<br>
            Everywhere and everywhere, the gang's smokey<br>
            Let the gangdem bring it on tour<br>
            Every day I hear niggas tryna draw me out<br>
            Why they all want me to war?<br>
            .44 long and that poisonous scopes<br>
            They don't want us bringing out both <br> <br> 

            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            Come look at the table, it's a lawn chair<br>
            I had go get, traphouse really had no air<br>
            You was out clubbin' with nowhere<br>
            OT, I had to go there<br>
            But then I ain't done a show here<br>
            Remember I had plans to go near<br>
            In the fast lane, I don't know where <br> <br> 

            [Chorus]<br>
            T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, theres both<br>
            Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke<br>
            Man spend it on both<br>
            Counting up this money from O or money from shows<br>
            Man's counting up both<br>

            [Verse 2]<br>
            I just dial up bro for a half a B and tell him pattern up coke<br>
            How many long afternoons did I spend in the T just bagging up both?<br>
            Jailhouse, scrambling eggs in a kettle<br>
            Just wishing I could have it with toast<br>
            I couldn't tell you how weak was a sunday roast<br>
            Rice pudding all in that bowl<br>
            See this life of sin, I'm just tryna make sure my heart stays pure<br>
            Feds had me locked for time<br>
            Evidence they would never find like Jah Cure<br>
            I was tryna get rich or die, fuck tryin'<br>
            I'd rather be dead than poor<br>
            I'm really out 'ere tryna govern it all<br>
            Money, power, respect and more <br> <br> 

            [Pre-Chorus]<br>

            I had go get, traphouse really had no air<br>

        <p>
            [Intro]
            Hello<br>
            Planet Earth<br>

            You have to wait for them so that they can wait for me<br>
            MSM, engineer, yeah <br> <br>

            But the trap still jumpin' (True)<br>
            Sold white on a pushbike in my brand new jeans<br>
            So I had the right leg tucked in (Greaze!)<br>
            Phone line rang so much<br>
            That the ringtone started to sound disgusting<br>
            Young boy in the kitchen with the powder<br>
            And I weren't making dumpling (Violent)<br>
            Stepped in the night show<br>
            See all the ladies start re-adjusting (Sexy)<br>
            Hat down low with the shades on<br>
            Looking like definitely up to something (Sus)<br>
            Please don’t step on my Sk’s 'cause I ain’t down for scuffing<br>
            I look at the game from a bird’s eye view<br>
            That’s why I see everyting properly<br>
            Top boy for too many years and still nobody can top me<br>
            It’s me they're all tryna sound like<br>
            It’s my gang they're all tryna copy, but I never complain<br>
            'Cause I got more where that came from (Greaze!)<br>
            I got the whole game on me (Alright)<br>
            Yeah, that’s what you get when you're chosen<br>
            Better protect your shit or your shit gets stolen<br>
            Get covered in ice, you gotta pay the price<br>
            For your wrist to be frozen<br>
            Still I’m outside, all of my chains on, out in the open<br>
            No security, you know the slogan<br>
            Who am I scared of? I am the omen<br>
            Greaze! <br> <br>

            [Bridge]<br>
            Ice, still reflecting<br>
            Skepta production <br> <br>

            We win awards, come home and Attack the Block<br>
            John Boyega when I’m acting up<br>
            Fuck lower case, I start capping up<br>
            'Till the big bad ting start backing up<br>
            Got a Spanish ting and she’s over sexy<br>
            That’s why the jokers wanna bo' select me (Huh)<br>
            But they cannot draw me out<br>
            Got the shades on, the lights don’t affect me<br>
            No watch on my wrist, no Big Timin’<br>
            Feds tryna find the whip I’m in<br>
            Pedal to the metal, this shit’s flying<br>
            Power steering, I’m slip sliding<br>
            Can’t see me, I stay too lowkey<br>
            No, we don’t do that dick riding (Grease)<br>
            I’m in my own lane just me<br>
            Yeah that’s why the plaques in the crib shining<br>
            But forget all the numbers, we’re the top boys<br>
            Even your girl knows, it’s blatant (Mhmm)<br>
            And that’s how it’s gonna be for a while<br>
            You niggas better have some patience (Trust)<br>
            No, we ain’t on the same platform<br>
            No, I’m at a different station (True)<br>
            Can’t see my face like Jason<br>
